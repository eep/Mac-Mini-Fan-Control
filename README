This is NOT a generic tool for Mac fan control. It will limit the fan
maximum speed, which may cause overheating, crashes or damage to the
computer.
 
This is a special tool for certain old Mac Minis (~2008) that have a
noisy fan after memory upgrade. See for example this:
http://nanchatte.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/solution-to-the-noisy-fans-on-a-core-2-duo-intel-mac-mini/
Tool will limit the maximum speed according to cpu temperature. The
limiting is done in steps with some hysteresis to avoid countinuous
adjusting. Temperature limits are hardcoded in code.

Code is based on smcFanControl (http://www.eidac.de/).
See README.smc for original README.
